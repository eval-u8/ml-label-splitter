# ml-label-splitter

Just a simple website to help a coworker with her labels.

It'll take specific label codes, destructure them, and output a list of only the important details of said codes. There is also the capability to copy the list of items to the clipboard. This minimizes human error and is more efficient due to the nature of the current manual process in place at work.

IMPORTANT: This only works for the types of labels used currently by my employer.
